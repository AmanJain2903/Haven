# Haven
The goal is to solve the "Storage Full" crisis by reclaiming data sovereignty. Haven moves your digital life to local hardware (SSD/HDD/NAS) without sacrificing the intelligence of the cloud. By running SOTA AI models locally, Haven provides semantic search, facial recognition, and geospatial grouping, ensuring your memories remain safe &amp; private.
